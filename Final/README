***************** Assignment 4 plus
./Quadanimation <filename>
3 files provided big.txt, small.txt, scene.txt,
most parameters can be changed in the text file need to put a space after the colon.
I don't parse through the file I just expect certain numbers and words at certain points.
I commented out the orientation code because it was incomplete and didn't work well, it should work on the lab computers now (I have not tested it, I just assumed).
Have a great summer, please go easy on the marking the final is going to kill me Cheers.
